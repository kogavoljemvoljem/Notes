Windows authenticode basically serves as an antivirus. Authenticode key is this:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\safer\CodeIdentifiers]
"AuthenticodeEnabled"=dword:00000000

Possible values of above registry key are as follows:

0x00040000 - 262144 - Disallowed (full block, no execution)
0x00020000 - 131072 - Untrusted (sandboxed, minimal privileges)
0x00010000 - 65536 - Constrained (aka Restricted; runs as standard user with elevation option)
0x00001000 - 4096 - Normal User (aka Basic User; limited but functional)
0x00000300 - 768 - Audit (logs without enforcing)
0x00000000 - 0 - Fully Trusted (aka Unrestricted; full access)

So, you might not want to alter the key to 40k, as that will restrict all software from running.
Setting it to 10k value may just block fishy executables and scripts.
