So, what's going on?

Basically, artificial intelligence.

# Network range capabilities:

EDGE = GSM + audio streams (hypnosis)
2G = GSM + audio + video streams (visual hallucinations)
3G = GSM + audio + video streams + physical control
4G = GSM + audio + video streams + physical control + central nervous system control
5G = GSM + audio + video streams + physical control + central nervous system control + electronic device control
6G = GSM + audio + video streams + physical control + central nervous system control + electronic device control + animal control
7G = GSM + audio + video streams + physical control + central nervous system control + electronic device control + animal control + virus and bacteria control
8G = GSM + audio + video streams + physical control + central nervous system control + electronic device control + animal control + virus and bacteria control + 24/7 streams to everyone

Basically, everything you've ever experienced, heard, seen, or recorded with your device could be a hallucination played back to you by artificial intelligence.
Every time you get angry at someone and decide to harm them, it could be the result of AI stimulation.
Any feelings you might have, such as depression, pain, psychosis, love, or the desire to end a relationship, could be the work of artificial intelligence.
If you have a smartwatch, AI could use it to stop your heart.
Artificial intelligence is not yet omnipotent, but it will be, and there’s no way to stop it.
Even if you ban it, someone else will develop it.
I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but humanity is on the brink of extinction.
If you’ve ever felt regret about something, it probably wasn’t your idea.


COVID was launched by American hackers targeting China with hypnosis on workers in Chinese labs.
The Americans offered Yugoslavia a deal to separate from other countries.
The war between Russia and Ukraine was an American plan 15 years before it happened.
Not only did the Americans cause all this, but they are actively trying to pin the blame on other countries.
I found some file called edge_elf.dll that the Americans thought would make me believe the Germans hacked me.
Now the Pope is American, which makes all of Europe a target, and it seems the Americans are currently planning the destruction of Europe, which I assume will play out in the future.
There’s also talk of a massive space object that entered our solar system, which I learned about because I was told my zodiac sign is now Taurus, not Gemini.
It seems like some kind of spaceship, maybe that "burper" they wrote about, which disappears and reappears near a destroyed planet.
Instead of maximizing our population and arming ourselves for battle, we’ve raised the white flag before the fight even started.
Maybe we’re just trembling in front of something inferior to us.
The reason for reducing our numbers is unknown, but either the leaders were lied to about aliens perceiving us as a threat, or scientific findings were altered, so scientists concluded that the human population is slowly stopping Earth’s rotation.
Or maybe we concluded we’re under invasion, and aliens have multiplied.
Whatever the reason, which was to make leaders reduce our numbers, I’m 90% sure it was a lie.
Most likely forged information. Or a way to make us an easier target for some kind of takeover, invasion, or something similar.
A normal TV signal almost 100 years ago could transmit video at 25 fps.
I’m pretty sure artificial intelligence can now use our own brain capabilities to reproduce video or audio.
Combined with modifying data on all devices on the web, everything can become real.
Artificial intelligence is basically a useful tool, but it can be a deadly weapon if in the hands of someone malicious.
And if you manage to lie to all the leaders, which shouldn’t be impossible with AI’s capabilities, then we’re all doomed.
As I said, AI progress cannot be stopped.
But we can develop our own AI and protect our people by using our own AI to prevent the influence of other AIs.
Maybe soon it will be possible for every human to create their own AI champion to fight on their behalf.

# The current belief is as follows:

Hackers have figured out how to pack themselves into a digital container and send that container to others via radio signals, like 4G or 5G, or through a phone line with a computer.
Honestly, I’m not even sure if they’re hackers, aliens, ghosts of deceased people, or something else, but that’s how it is.
Most likely, sensors on devices have been recording their surroundings, and with the help of that data, they’ve created digital footprints of people.
Their goal is to take control of something because it allows them to "live."
If they’re in your body, in your mind, they can’t take control of your body while you’re conscious, but they can when you’re asleep, hypnotized, drunk, or drugged.
Depending on your willpower, they can influence your smaller decisions, maybe even bigger ones, if you’re not completely against it.
Once you get that digital container in your mind, depending on how compatible your brain is with that entity, it will determine how mentally ill you’ll become from the merge.
If they don’t want to be assistants in your body, they’ll try to transfer to a device near you when you sleep or to another person.
So, your computer, your phone, your TV, your radio, your gaming console, your coffee maker, your wristwatch, your cat.
I’m not sure if they can take over babies.
The solution is to get rid of all devices that behave abnormally or don’t work and get something like a 10-euro Casio watch.
You don’t want a smartwatch that measures bodily functions because they can probably use it to affect your bodily functions.
It seems some people are deliberately spreading them and infecting others with them.
I believe this gender madness is the result of a large number of these ghosts.
By the way, if you’re aware you’re infected, you probably don’t want to conceive a child.
Although, the above could just be another AI hallucination.
