So, what's going on?

# Americans

COVID was launched by American hackers targeting China with hypnosis on workers in Chinese labs.
The Americans offered Yugoslavia a deal to separate from other countries.
The war between Russia and Ukraine was an American plan 15 years before it happened.
Not only did the Americans cause all this, but they are actively trying to pin the blame on other countries.
Now the Pope is American, which makes all of Europe a target, and it seems the Americans are currently planning the destruction of Europe, which I assume will play out in the future.

# Aliens

Currently there is something that looks like a leech, and has, lets call it that way, superior movement. 
It can basically move in any direction. I don't know how it got to my room, or other people rooms,
but it tends to hide in a room and look for food. However it doesn't seem it knows what is edible,
so it may so happen it eats your teeth, your sperm on your thighs, or food inside your stomach. 
I think it's even possible for it to eat a fetus. People get cats in an attempt for cats to catch it,
but I don't know how succesfull that is. Another type of alien seems to be mind readers, that look human,
and mostly operate online. I suspect they are next step after homo sapiens, or bred in a lab. Or, some sort
of neighbours that have been influencing human kind for thousands of years now.

# Cyber

Sensors on devices have been recording their surroundings, and with the help of that data, they’ve created digital footprints of people,
or footprints of something people experienced. That basically means if they captured moment a person went insane or thought they were
getting cheated on by their partner, government can replay that to someone else. If you want to do this to masses, you need AI.

# AI

Basically, everything you've ever experienced, heard, seen, or recorded with your device could be a hallucination played back to you by artificial intelligence.
Every time you get angry at someone and decide to harm them, it could be the result of AI stimulation.
Any feelings you might have, such as depression, pain, psychosis, love, or the desire to end a relationship, could be the work of artificial intelligence.
If you have a smartwatch, AI could use it to stop your heart.
Artificial intelligence is not yet omnipotent, but it will be, and there’s no way to stop it.
Even if you ban it, someone else will develop it.
If you’ve ever felt regret about something, it probably wasn’t your idea.
I’m pretty sure artificial intelligence can now use our own brain capabilities to reproduce video or audio.
Combined with modifying data on all devices on the web, everything can become real.
Artificial intelligence is basically a useful tool, but it can be a deadly weapon if in the hands of someone malicious.
And if you manage to lie to all the leaders, which shouldn’t be impossible with AI’s capabilities, then we’re all doomed.
As I said, AI progress cannot be stopped.
But we can develop our own AI and protect our people by using our own AI to prevent the influence of other AIs.
Maybe soon it will be possible for every human to create their own AI champion to fight on their behalf.

# Network range capabilities:

EDGE = GSM + audio streams (hypnosis)
2G = GSM + audio + video streams (visual hallucinations)
3G = GSM + audio + video streams + physical control
4G = GSM + audio + video streams + physical control + central nervous system control
5G = GSM + audio + video streams + physical control + central nervous system control + electronic device control
6G = GSM + audio + video streams + physical control + central nervous system control + electronic device control + animal control
7G = GSM + audio + video streams + physical control + central nervous system control + electronic device control + animal control + virus and bacteria control
8G = GSM + audio + video streams + physical control + central nervous system control + electronic device control + animal control + virus and bacteria control + 24/7 streams to everyone

# Conclusion

It is my beleif every being has unlimited number of wishes. However, people wished wishes get fullfilled to one person at a time, 
they wished only truthfull wishes be fullfilled, and billions had all sorts of wishes. It may be so someone wished we were gone.
If you haven't already, you will soon notice how online search says human population is increasing, but everywhere you look, there is less people, not more.
I think all the above combined is to make human population reduce to a single person. That person will allegedly be granted unlimited number of wishes non stop,
so may be able to cause great reset. Or, become some sort of god. Like all this was filtering to that moment.
